# Write a function 'count_construct(target, word_bank)' that accepts a
# target string and an array of strings.
# 
# The function should return the number of ways that the 'target' can
# be constructed by concatenating elements of the 'word_bank' array.
# 
# You may reuse elements of 'word_bank' as many times as needed.
